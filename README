This is script is intended to ping the email of a particular user using IMAP and download the emails and add them as pivotal stoires in the project. We have to make sure that IMAP is enabled for the email account which we ping.

This is inspired from http://www.mobilecommons.com/developers/open-source/pivotal-tracker-email-integration/

Add a cron job to run this every 5 minutes. For this goto the console. Here 5 minutes is the ping duration

crontab -e
*/5 * * * * ruby /home/app/email_to_pt.rb >> /mnt/app/shared/email_to_pt/email_to_pt.log 2>&1i

This script is used only for gmail and its apps. We can change line no 92 to make for all email clients
